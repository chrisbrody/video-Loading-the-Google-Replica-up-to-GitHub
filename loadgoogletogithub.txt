#FILE_PATH 1.1 - Intro to Exploring a file's file path
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, in this video I want to load up our Google replication project to Github.

Hopefully you've watched either of the videos showing you how to build this website. otherwise check out the video description for links to those videos

If you haven't completed the replica yet, check out the video links in the description.



#LOAD_GOOGLE 1.2 - Changing to folder we want to upload in the command line
Other wise we can begin. Open up your terminal or command prompt.

Here, we need to change to the folder we want to load to GitHub, mine is called google-replica, which is in a folder called week01, which is in a folder called codify and that is in my Desktop folder.

So after cd I'll add my file path to get to my google project.

mine will be cd desktop/codify/google-replica



#LOAD_GOOGLE 1.3 - Create a repo for the project @ GitHub.com
The terminal is set, lets go to github.com and create a repo.

I'll call mine google-replica and I'll add a description - a simple replication of the google homepage.



#LOAD_GOOGLE 1.4 - Uploading the files from the command line
Now GitHub is set and we are ready to push the project files.

In the terminal use ls or dir to list your files, and confirm your location.

as long as your in the right spot, you can go ahead with git init to start tracking this repo

then git add . to add the files we want to load.

then git commit -m "with a message", I'll say first version complete.

next go and copy and paste in the 4th command to set the location of repo.

and last git push origin master to load up the files



#LOAD_GOOGLE 1.5 - Confirm the files were loaded
Now wait a few seconds, and refresh the browser when the terminal is done, and you should see your files no GitHub.


#LOAD_GOOGLE 1.6 - Outro to loading up google replica to GitHub
Awesome, hopefully that worked for you, and remember if you run into an error you can't fix, you can delete the hidden git folder we looked at a few videos ago.

And where you're practicing don't forget you can add that code to a repo on GitHub, employers want to see you actively coding.
